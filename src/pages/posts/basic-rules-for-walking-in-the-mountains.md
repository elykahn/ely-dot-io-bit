excerpt: >-
  Moving across the United States can be a transformational experience,
  something I learned the first time I moved away from Little Rock on my own to
  go to undergrad in Portland. Never did I imagine moving back as I found “home”
  on the West Coaast, first in Portland & then in San Francisco, yet here I am.
